# Geospatial analysis and representation for Data Science - Final Project
For this project my goal was to create a script meant to compute travel and accomodation time for holiday purposes, from any given city to any other within the same region. 

The script works, but due to computation constraints (mainly the amount of RAM available to me), I was only able to make it run on a province base, meaning computing travel and accomodations for cities within the same province.
Since this work is supposed to be interactive and provide different outputs based on the settings you specify, for the R part I chose a specific city and conditions (a trip to Rimini, with prices for 2 people staying for 2 nights) and performed statistical analysis with these specific terms.

Here is a rundown of the content in this Github Folder:
- **code** this repository contains the main code, divided in 3 parts. The reason I did this was to better describe each step and provide some context.
It also includes a working version of the script, named *trip_calculator_demo.ipynb*, where I tested the code on a travel from Sassuolo to the city of Modena.
- **resources** here are the files you should download locally in the same environment you want to run the code, specifically the 3<sup>rd</sup> part which uses R to perform a statistical analysis.
- *Trip_calculator.ipynb* is the version you want to use if you only want to test the code without bothering to examine the script or have intermediate outputs.
